# Pressure Loss Calculator Tool - Matlab
A Matlab tool calculating the friction pressure loss in circular pipes with full flow water. The tool has the options in selecting the solver type through the equations either by 'Darcy-Weisbach' or by 'Hazen-Williams'. Besides, another feature in the tool options allows users to select through various algorithms to calculate the Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient *f*, limited to algorithms by 'Moody','Colebrook-White','Clamond','Swamee-Jain','Zigrang-Sylvester', and 'Haaland'.
